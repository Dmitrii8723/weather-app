//Steps to set up and run an application:

Important!!! - use a version of node js - 10.13.0

1) You need to install mongoDB and create an instance of DB with name "test" on your local machine 

(make sure that the port 27017 is in use, otherwise change it in index.js file to a port that is in use on your local machine)

2) To run an app use the command: node index.js -k {apiKey} (Should see 'Listening on port 3000.....')

4) Open your browser and use the link below in order to access the application:
